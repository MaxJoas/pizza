# Hands-on for Data-Centric AI Pizza Seminar

## Getting started

You have two options for this hands-on:
- Option 1: Implement the confident learning algorithm (how to find label errors) from my talk
    - For this option go to the file `./label_erros/handson.ipynb`
    - You'll install the required packages in the notebook
    - If you get stuck, there is a solution `./label_erros/solution.ipynb`
- Option 2: Work with your data
    - In case you have brought your data and want to find label errors or apply another data-centric technique, work with `./your_project/project.ipynb`

This hands-on is based on the lab assignment of this [course] (https://github.com/dcai-course/dcai-lab).
I've shortened the assignment and made minor adjustments
